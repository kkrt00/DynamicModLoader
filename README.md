### DynamicModLoader
Hot Load and Reload Vintage Story's mod dll in VS Code

### Why
I wasnt happy with 30s world loading time, which for me affects greatly mod development iteration time.  
Also i didnt want to use Visual Studio just for its Edit & Continue feature, this method should be more powerful than edit and continue. 

### General info
As names suggest:
ModLoader: is a mod that loads other mods  
SamplePopUp: is just mod that loaded as an example

Please note that ModLoader/.vscode/launch.json loads "test" world, game will create new one with this name if save wont be found in data folder  

Usage ingame:  
To load mod press **U**  
To activate popUp press **O**
